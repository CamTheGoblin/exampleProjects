# Example Projects
Here are just a few examples of personal projects I am currently working on.

## TableGoblin Virtual Tabletop
A multi-user simulated tabletop for tabletop role playing games. I was looking for something a bit simpler then most of the virtual tabletops out there that I could use to quickly throw together new battle maps on the fly for my games. It includes a 3d dice roller, initiative tracker and token creation system. It is still in development at this time but I look forward to sharing it with others once it is completed!

This project was created with Reactjs for the frontend and Feathersjs backend to utilize socket.io for real time updates as users interact and move tokens on a map.

## Squid Launcher Twitch Physics Overlay
The Squid Launcher is an overlay I created for my friend, the Twitch streamer pipsqueak_squid: https://www.twitch.tv/pipsqueak_squid. Check out her streams! It allows the streamer to spawn squid characters that use matter.js physics to fly across the screen and collide with each other, the screen edge and streamer video window. Squids generate physics based splashes when the fall off screen. Squid spawning set to be triggered when a viewer follows the channel. Streamer can also trigger physics based fireworks.
built with React.js and utilizing matter.js to create physics simulation of squid characters, splashes and fireworks for use on a twitch stream channel.
